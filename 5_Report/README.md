## INTRODUCTION:

Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed
and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear
window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper
arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called
pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper.

Existing system manually used control stalk to activate wiper and the process of pulling up wiper is difficult to be
handled. The driver needs to switch on and off the control stalk and it will reduce the driver’s concentration during the
driving. In this project, there were two innovations reviewed as the literature review. The two were designed with different
concept and operating mechanism however with same objective of working principle of the car wiper. The rain sensor
was a highly versatile device for automatic wiping of vehicle windscreen when it is wet due to moisture, raindrops or
even mud .

It worked by reflecting harmonious light beams within the windscreen. When raindrops fall onto the
windscreen, this harmony light is been disturbed and creating a drop in the light beam intensity. The system then
activated the wipers to be operated in full automatic mode. It has a response time at 0.1 seconds. It allowed for a quick
reaction when it is a sudden splashes of water that will make the driver totally ‘blinds’ when the situation happened.
With the automatic wiper, the driver can avert from the risk of an accident. The automatic wiper is important during
Trailing a wet car is no longer a nuisance as detection of even 0.005 milliliters of water is
possible.

## CONCLUSION:

As the conclusion for the project, the results shows all the aim objectives are successfully achieved. The wiper system
was well functionally according the water condition from the outside of a car. This project showed a contribution on the
design of the automatic wiper system for the future research in this field. For the future improvement, it is
recommended the system to have literature review on the material been used as the wiper, because the material used is
still has a problem in the procure issues especially for the hot and climate country. Other suggestion for designing
automatic push up wiper for future research and improvement is about the design stand for the wiper
